# Umeme Upo?

A Next Js app that shows you the current power status of various areas in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

There are 2 main repositories for this project:

- [Umeme Upo](https://github.com/fredygerman/umeme-upo) - The Next Js Web App
- [Umeme Upo Esp32-ping](https://github.com/fredygerman/umeme-upo-esp32-ping) - The ESP32 code that adds a new record to the database every after a certain amount of time.

## How it works

1. The ESP32 device pings makes a request to the API every 5 minutes. This is like a heartbeat.
2. The API then adds a new record to the database recording the time and location of the ping.
3. When a user visits the website, the website checks the database for the last ping if it was within the last 5 minutes, it shows the power status as ON, otherwise it shows the power status as OFF.

## Database Schema

The example schema for the database per area is as follows:

```sql
-- Create makumbusho_logs table
CREATE TABLE makumbusho_logs (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
    errors jsonb DEFAULT '{}',
    source text
);
```

```sql
-- Create makumbusho_errors table
CREATE TABLE makumbusho_errors (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
    errors jsonb DEFAULT '{}',
    source text
);
```

## API

The API is auto generated by [Supabase](https://supabase.io/). You can view the API docs [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api).
This helps us use the ESP32 devices to add new records to the database by making a simple request to the API.
i.e. `POST https://<your-project>.supabase.co/rest/v1/<your-table>` with the body being the data you want to add.
