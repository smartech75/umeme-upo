## Design (UI/UX)

The Amazing design as seen on the screensshots has been done by [@faustin_henry](https://twitter.com/faustin_henry).

You can help improve it by visiting the [Figma File](https://www.figma.com/file/it33dzvxrxfhFDlnGX3h53/Umeme-Upo%3F?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=6qOce4RvCVWTaUnq-1) and requesting access.

## How it works

Umeme Upo calls my directus Instance API to get the latest power status update from the database.

My directus instance is running on a self hosted server. It has a cron job (Directus Flow) that runs every 5 minutes to update the power status in the database.

The Directus Flow pings my Home Assistant instance Ip address to check if it is online. If it is online it updates the database. If it is offline, marks the power status as maybe offline and checks again in 10 minutes. (this is to avoid false positives which can happen when the internet is down, but power is still on, or when my server is down due to updates or maintenance)

## Tech Stack

- Next Js
- Typescript
- Tailwind CSS
- Directus (my headless CMS)
- ESP32 device to ping my Directus Server
- Vercel (Hosting)

IF you need help setting up everything with your own instance of Directus, Home Assistant or Vercel, please open an issue or contact me on [@fredygerman\_](https://twitter.com/fredygerman_)
